            I am Leul. It's pronounced like Luke but instead of 'k' it's 'l'.
            I am majoring in computer science and plan to go into AI studies. And I'm from Ethiopia but also I was just attending a highschool in Pennsylvania.
            From this class, I am hoping to get useful skills that will help me be succesful in my major and future career.
            And I am a follower of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
            <br> I love playing tennis so if you want a tennis-buddy, I'm here guys!
